; This file defines the base virtual addresses for Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL)
; that are part of the Tcl System.  The first token on a line is the name
; of the DLL and the second token is the base virtual address, in hexidecimal.
; The third token is the maximum size of the DLL image file, including symbols.
;
; Using a specified "prefered load address" should speed load-time by avoiding
; relocations.  It is assumed extension author will contribute their modules
; to this grand-master one.
