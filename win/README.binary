Tcl/Tk 8.1 for Windows, Binary Distribution

RCS: @(#) $Id$ 

1. Introduction
--------------- 

This directory contains the binary distribution of Tcl/Tk 8.1.0 for
Windows.  It was compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 using Win32
API, so that it will run under Windows NT, Windows 95, and Windows 98.

Tcl provides a powerful platform for creating integration applications
that tie together diverse applications, protocols, devices, and
frameworks.  When paired with the Tk toolkit, Tcl provides the fastest
and most powerful way to create GUI applications that run on PCs, Unix,
and the Macintosh.  Tcl can also be used for a variety of web-related
tasks and for creating powerful command languages for applications.

Tcl is maintained, enhanced, and distributed freely as a service to the
Tcl community by Scriptics Corporation.

Windows.  Microsoft has completely dropped support of the Win32s
subsystem.

this release, you will need to use the appropriate .lib file for your

are library files for the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler:

	tcl81.lib
	tk81.lib

Please refer to the example dynamically loadable extension provided on

or post them to the newsgroup comp.lang.tcl.

7. Tcl newsgroup
-----------------

There is a network news group "comp.lang.tcl" intended for the exchange
of information about Tcl, Tk, and related applications.  Feel free to use
the newsgroup both for general information questions and for bug reports.
We read the newsgroup and will attempt to fix bugs and problems reported
to it.

When using comp.lang.tcl, please be sure that your e-mail return address
is correctly set in your postings.  This allows people to respond directly
to you, rather than the entire newsgroup, for answers that are not of
general interest.  A bad e-mail return address may prevent you from
getting answers to your questions.  You may have to reconfigure your news
reading software to ensure that it is supplying valid e-mail addresses.
