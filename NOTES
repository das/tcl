Pre-notes

	The cutting of the channel system is not as clean as I would like
	it to be, simply because cisco has the special need of a channel
	system trimmed down to the std* channels, without complete removal.
	I am not sure that I have removed the maximum amount of C Api's
	and functions possible for this specific configuration.

	A first step in rationalizing this section would be NO_CHANNELS
	to remove the I/O system completely, and then NO_NONSTDCHAN
	for minial exposure of channels. NO_FILEEVENTS is orthogonal
	to NO_NONSTDCHAN. Drivers are possible only if not NO_CHANNELS,
	but can be disabled separately. The standard channels need the
	"file" driver (currently not disable-able), should use #ifdef's
	to ensure integrity.

	=>	Would be interesting to have a configuration tool which
		is able to express and enforce these constraints.

	=>	The linux core configuration uses the domain specific
		language CML2 (Eric Raymond, written in Python).

	!	Investigate possible usage of SourceNavigator as
		basic for parsing the Tcl core. Use custom tools to
		follow dependencies between structures and functions.

		(What-If tools: What if I exclude this function/struct,
		what else can be removed, or requires this).

		Also: What are the leaf functions in the system ...

	!	Mapping help: Associate functions with functional areas
		and see how the areas relate, how much can be removed
		whenever an area is excluded ...

Shrinking the core.
	Filesystem

Shrinking the usage of stack
	Large static arrays on the stack
	Look for #define's, check usage, create #defines if necessary
	DString !! (initial dstring data in structure!)
	RE's ?
	NRE1

	== running a stack test of the full test suite for a build is 1.5 hours ==
	== something for the evening and the night ==

Macros
	TCL_NO_<feature>	to deactivate/cut feature
	MODULAR_TCL		activates all TCL_NO_<feature> macros
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cut 1
	The cut currently restricts itself to the UNIX and GENERIC parts.
	No changes in Win* and Mac areas.

	channel system
	-	no sockets		TCL_NO_SOCKETS			/
	-	no serial/tty		TCL_NO_TTY			/
	-	no pipes		TCL_NO_PIPES			/
	-	no pid command		TCL_NO_PIDCMD			/
	-	channel system provides	TCL_NO_NONSTDCHAN		/
		only std* channels [x]
	-	no channel copying	TCL_NO_CHANNELCOPY		/
	-	no [read]ing		TCL_NO_CHANNEL_READ		/
	-	no [eof] [/]		TCL_NO_CHANNEL_EOF		/
	-	no channel set/get cfg	TCL_NO_CHANNEL_CONFIG	[+]	/
	-	no [fblocked]		TCL_NO_CHANNEL_BLOCKED	[/]	/
	-	no fileevents		TCL_NO_FILEEVENTS	[=]	/

	filesystem
	-	disable filesystem	TCL_NO_FILESYSTEM	[%]	/*
	-	disable load'ing	TCL_NO_LOADCMD			/

	master/slave interpreters
	-	disable slave interp	TCL_NO_SLAVEINTERP		/*
	-	disable command aliases	TCL_NO_CMDALIASES		/*

[*]	Access from the C level is not removed.

[x]	Implies that no .rc can be read during unix init.
	Implies that no startup script can be read by tclsh.
	Implies NO_SOCKETS, NO_TTY, NO_PIPES
	Implies currently 'no "source" cmd' and	no loading of encoding files.
	In the generic case this functionality can the reimplemented by direct
	OS calls without using the channel system. Makes the
	implementation platform dependent. As Cisco doesn't want this functionality
	we disable them without adding a new implementation.
	Implies that channels cannot be moved/shared between master/slave interps.
	(seek is removed under the assumption that the std* channels are not seekable)

[/]	Tcl_Eof, Tcl_InputBlocked stay because they are required by [gets].

[+]	Tcl_SetChannelOption stays, required for initial config of std channels.

[=]	Implies no socket servers. Reason: Accept callback for socket server
	is done through fev's

[%]	Ripping the filesystem intrudes heavily on the startup sequence of the
	interpreter as auto_path, package paths, etc. can't be initialized anymore.
	This also cuts into the initialization of encodings.

	Given that encodings will be changed later to not use UTF internally this
	is no big deal. For Cisco. Others might want to have 'no fs', but UTF.

	We have to check that the startup sequence is still operational.

	Given that without a FS loading of encoding from files is
	impossible the loss of initialization is again not so big a deal.

Handling of stub table when cutting features:

1.	Disable all functions for the feature, from the bottom up to
	the top (script level command). This includes full disabling
	of stub functions too.

	The bottom-up approach enforces link errors in the higher
	levels and thus allows us to use the compiler to find all
	relevant places where we have to cut.

	Cutting stub functions is essential to find everything.

2.	Go through the functions causing link errors in tclStubInit.o
	== stub functions. Add variants which are empty, return errors
	etc. and compile these when the feature is disabled.

	** Changed **
	Add suppressor definitions to "tcl*.decls" and regen the code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future:
	Implement a mechanism for 'tcl.decls'
	which allows the definition of (static, loadable) sub packages.
	So that the stub table is minimally initialized and
	sub packages initialize their slots when loaded.

Cut 2, Working on the stacksize.

*	Spliced the NRE1 engine by Miguel Sofer into
	the core. Stack testing the testsuite show
	an average saving of 4 K stack space.

*	Reducing amount of characters directly stored in
	a DString structure from 200 to 1. Average
	savings when going through testsuite:

*	Going through #defines in headers and sources
	to identify more locations placing data on the
	stack.

New controlling macros.

#define TCL_NO_RECURSE		/* enables the NRE modifications */
	set by default

Tcl_ExternalToUtfDString is in trouble for TCL_DSTRING_STATIC_SIZE=1 I
guess TDSS < UTF_MAX is trouble because the function does not check
before attempting the first conversion. ... Ok, SZ=25 is ok for the
testsuite. This doesn't mean that it is ok in real life, but encoding
is cut of for cisco, so we can screw this here. Keep in mind for
later.

1,4,5,10,17	fail
21,25	ok

General look through the code for static buffers
on the stack.

tclAlloc	/ok
tclAsync	/ok
tclBasic	Tcl_CallWhenDeleted		32+INT_SPACE
		Tcl_ExprString			TCL_DOUBLE_SPACE
tclBinary	/ok
tclClock	/ok
tclCmdAH	StoreStatData			TCL_INTEGER_SPACE
		Tcl_FormatObjCmd

...(Obj)Cmd functions often hold quite a lot of state in local
variables.

For exact measurements we have to instrument the C code with
additional (macroized) function calls to record exact sizes for every
invoked C function. Automatic instrumentation is difficult. Could
instrument the dispatchers first (where commands are invoked) to get
stack sizes for bigger blocks of execution (command + utility
functionality called by it).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A big structure is 'CompileEnv'. Instead of trying to reduce its size
it might be better to allocate the whole structure of the heap.

#define TCL_COMPENV_ON_HEAP    /* Allocate temp. CompileEnv structs off the heap */
