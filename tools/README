Generating HTML files.
The tcl8.1-tk8.1-man-html.tcl script from Robert Critchlow
generates a nice set of HTML with good cross references.
Use it like
    tclsh8.0 tcl8.1-tk8.1-man-html.tcl --htmldir=/tmp/tcl8.1
This script is very picky about the organization of man pages,
effectively acting as a style enforcer.

Generating Windows Help Files:
1) Build tcl in the ../unix directory
2) On UNIX, (after autoconf and configure), do
	make
    this converts the Nroff to RTF files.
2) On Windows, convert the RTF to a Help doc, do
	nmake helpfile

Generating Windows binary distribution.
Update and compile the WYSE tcl.wse configuration.
