.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fB::struct::stack\fR command creates a new stack object with an
associated global Tcl command whose name is \fIstackName\fR.  This command
may be used to invoke various operations on the stack.  It has the
following general form:
.CS
\fIstackName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.CE
\fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following
commands are possible for stack objects:
.TP
\fIstackName \fBclear\fR
Remove all items from the stack.
.TP
\fIstackName \fBdestroy\fR
Destroy the stack, including its storage space and associated command.
.TP
\fIstackName \fBpeek\fR ?\fIcount\fR?
Return the top \fIcount\fR items of the stack, without removing them
from the stack.  If \fIcount\fR is not specified, it defaults to 1.
If \fIcount\fR is 1, the result is a simple string; otherwise, it is a list.
If specified, \fIcount\fR must be greater than or equal to 1.  If
there are no items on the stack, this command will return \fIcount\fR
empty strings.
.TP
\fIstackName \fBpop\fR ?\fIcount\fR?
Return the top \fIcount\fR items of the stack and remove them
from the stack.  If \fIcount\fR is not specified, it defaults to 1.
If \fIcount\fR is 1, the result is a simple string; otherwise, it is a list.
If specified, \fIcount\fR must be greater than or equal to 1.  If
there are no items on the stack, this command will return \fIcount\fR
empty strings.
.TP
\fIstackName \fBpush\fR \fIitem\fR ?\fIitem ...\fR?
Push the item or items specified onto the stack.  If more than one
item is given, they will be pushed in the order they are listed.
.TP
