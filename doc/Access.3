.SH NAME
Tcl_Access, Tcl_Stat \- check file permissions and other attributes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTcl_Access\fR(\fpath\fR, \fImode\fR)
.sp
int
\fBTcl_Stat\fR(\fIpath\fR, \fIbufPtr\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS struct stat *bufPtr
.AP CONST char *path in
Native name of the file to check the attributes of.
.AP int mode in
Mask consisting of one or more of R_OK, W_OK, X_OK and F_OK.  R_OK,
W_OK and X_OK request checking whether the file exists and  has  read,
write and  execute  permissions, respectively.  F_OK just requests
checking for the existence of the file.
.AP struct stat *bufPtr out
The structure that contains the result.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
There are two reasons for calling \fBTcl_Access\fR and \fBTcl_Stat\fR
rather than calling system level functions \fBaccess\fR and \fBstat\fR
directly.  First, the Windows implementation of both functions fixes
some bugs in the system level calls.  Second, both \fBTcl_Access\fR
and \fBTcl_Stat\fR (as well as \fBTcl_OpenFileChannelProc\fR) hook
into a linked list of functions, the first of which checks for the
existence of \fBpath\fR in a Zip file rather than on disc.  The
hooking behavior is necessary for applications wrapped with TclPro
Wrapper.
.PP
\fBTcl_Access\fR checks whether the process would be allowed to read,
write or test for existence of the file (or other file system object)
whose name is pathname.   If pathname is a symbolic link on Unix,
then permissions of the file referred by this symbolic link are
tested.
.PP
On success (all requested permissions granted), zero is returned.  On
error (at least one bit in mode asked for a permission that is denied,
or some other  error occurred), -1 is returned.
.PP
\fBTcl_Stat\fR returns the stat structure with information about the
specified file.  You do not need any access rights to the file to get
this information but you need search rights to all directories named
in the path leading to the file.
