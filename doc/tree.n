.SH NAME
::struct::tree \- Create and manipulate tree objects
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpackage require struct ?1.0?\fR
.sp
\fB::struct::tree\fR \fItreeName\fR
.sp
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fB::struct::tree\fR command creates a new tree object with an
associated global Tcl command whose name is \fItreeName\fR.  This command
may be used to invoke various operations on the tree.  It has the
following general form:
.CS
\fItreeName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.CE
\fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following
commands are possible for tree objects:
.TP
\fItreeName \fBclear\fR
Remove all nodes from the tree.
.TP
\fItreeName \fBdestroy\fR
Destroy the tree, including its storage space and associated command.
.TP
\fItreeName \fBinsert\fR \fIindex\fR \fIparent\fR \fIchild\fR ?-value \fIvalue\fR?
Insert a node named \fIchild\fR into the tree as a child of the node
\fIparent\fR.  If \fIparent\fR is \fBroot\fR, it refers to the root of
the tree.  The new node will have the value given by \fIvalue\fR.  The
new node will be added to the \fIparent\fR node's childlist at the
index given by \fIindex\fR.
.TP
\fItreeName\fR \fBchildren\fR \fInode\fR
Return a list of the children of \fInode\fR.
.TP
\fItreeName\fR \fBparent\fR \fInode\fR
Return the parent of \fInode\fR.
.TP
\fItreeName\fR \fBnodeconfigure\fR \fInode\fR -value \fIvalue\fR
Set the associated value of a particular node.
.TP
\fItreeName\fR \fBnodecget\fR \fInode\fR -value
Return the associated value of a particular node.
.TP
\fItreeName\fR \fBdelete\fR \fInode\fR ?\fInode\fR ...?
Remove the specified nodes from the tree.  All of the nodes' children
will be removed as well to prevent orphaned nodes.  An entire tree
could be removed in this fashion with the command:
.CS
\fItreeName\fR \fBdelete\fR [\fItreeName\fR \fBchildren\fR root]
.CE
.TP
\fItreeName\fR \fBmove\fR \fInode\fR \fIparent\fR \fIindex\fR
Make \fInode\fR a child of \fIparent\fR, inserting it
into the parent's child list at the index given by \fIindex\fR.
.TP
\fItreeName\fR \fBexists\fR \fInode\fR
Remove true if the specified node exists in the tree.
