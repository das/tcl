.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBtcltest\fR package provides several utility commands useful
in the construction of test suites for code instrumented to be
run by evaluation of Tcl commands.  Notably the built-in commands
of the Tcl library itself are tested by a test suite using the
tcltest package.
.PP
All the commands provided by the \fBtcltest\fR package are defined
in and exported from the \fB::tcltest\fR namespace, as indicated in
the \fBSYNOPSIS\fR above.  In the following sections, all commands
will be described by their simple names, in the interest of brevity.
.PP
The central command of \fBtcltest\fR is [\fBtest\fR] that defines
and runs a test.  Testing with [\fBtest\fR] involves evaluation
of a Tcl script and comparing the result to an expected result, as
configured and controlled by a number of options.  Several other
commands provided by \fBtcltest\fR govern the configuration of
[\fBtest\fR] and the collection of many [\fBtest\fR] commands into
test suites.
.PP
See \fBCREATING TEST SUITES WITH TCLTEST\fR below for an extended example
of how to use the commands of \fBtcltest\fR to produce test suites
for your Tcl-enabled code.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
\fBtest\fR \fIname description ?option value ...?\fR
Defines and possibly runs a test with the name \fIname\fR and
description \fIdescription\fR.  The name and description of a test
are used in messages reported by [\fBtest\fR] during the
test, as configured by the options of \fBtcltest\fR.  The
remaining \fIoption value\fR arguments to [\fBtest\fR]
define the test, including the scripts to run, the conditions
under which to run them, the expected result, and the means
by which the expected and actual results should be compared.
See \fBTESTS\fR below for a complete description of the valid
options and how they define a test.  The [\fBtest\fR] command
returns an empty string.  
.TP
\fBtest\fR \fIname description ?constraints? body result\fR
This form of [\fBtest\fR] is provided to support test suites written
for version 1 of the \fBtcltest\fR package, and also a simpler
interface for a common usage.  It is the same as
[\fBtest\fR \fIname description\fB -constraints \fIconstraints\fB -body
\fIbody\fB -result \fIresult\fR].  All other options to [\fBtest\fR]
take their default values.  When \fIconstraints\fR is omitted, this
form of [\fBtest\fR] can be distinguished from the first because
all \fIoption\fRs begin with ``-''.
.TP
\fBtest\fR \fIname description optionList\fR
This form of [\fBtest\fR] was provided to enable passing many
options spanning several lines to [\fBtest\fR] as a single
argument quoted by braces, rather than needing to backslash quote
the newlines between arguments to [\fBtest\fR].  The \fIoptionList\fR
argument is expected to be a list with an even number of elements
representing \fIoption\fR and \fIvalue\fR arguments to pass
to [\fBtest\fR].  However, these values are not passed directly, as
in the alternate forms of [\fBswitch\fR].  Instead, this form makes
an unfortunate attempt to overthrow Tcl's substitution rules by
performing substitutions on some of these elements as an attempt to
implement a "do what I mean" interpretation of a brace-enclosed
``block''.  The result is nearly impossible to document clearly, and
for that reason this form is not recommended.  See \fBTESTS\fR below
for better ways to reduce the need to backslash quote newlines
when calling [\fBtest\fR].  If you insist on using this form, examine
the source code of \fBtcltest\fR if you want to know the substitution
details, or just enclose the third through last argument
to [\fBtest\fR] in braces and hope for the best.
.TP
\fBloadTestedCommands\fR
Evaluates the script specified by the [\fBconfigure -load\fR]
or [\fBconfigure -loadfile\fR] configuration options in the
caller's context.  Returns the result of that script evaluation,
including any error raised by the script.  Use this command
and the related configuration options to provide the commands
to be tested to the interpreter running the test suite.
.TP
\fBmakeFile\fR \fIcontents name ?directory?\fR
Create a file named \fIname\fR relative to
directory \fIdirectory\fR and write \fIcontents\fR
to that file using the encoding [\fBencoding system\fR].
Because the system encoding is used, this command
is only suitable for making text files.
The file will will be removed by the next evaluation
of [\fBcleanupTests\fR], unless it is removed by
[\fBremoveFile\fR] first.  The default value of
\fIdirectory\fR is the directory specified by
the \fB-tmpdir\fR option to [\fBconfigure\fR].
Returns the full path of the file created.  Use this command
to create any text file required by a test with contents as needed.
.TP
\fBremoveFile\fR \fIname ?directory?\fR
Force the file referenced by \fIname\fR to be removed.  This file name
should be relative to \fIdirectory\fR.   If left unspecified,
\fIdirectory\fR defaults to the directory specified by
the \fB-tmpdir\fR option to [\fBconfigure\fR].
Returns an empty string.  Use this command to delete files
created by [\fBmakeFile\fR].  
.TP
\fBmakeDirectory\fR \fIname ?directory?\fR
Create a directory named \fIname\fR relative to directory \fIdirectory\fR.
The directory will be removed by the next evaluation of [\fBcleanupTests\fR],
unless it is removed by [\fBremoveDirectory\fR] first.
The default value of \fIdirectory\fR is the directory specified by
the \fB-tmpdir\fR option to [\fBconfigure\fR].
Returns the full path of the directory created.  Use this command
to create any directories that are required to exist by a test.
.TP
\fBremoveDirectory\fR \fIname ?directory?\fR
Force the directory referenced by \fIname\fR to be removed. This
directory should be relative to \fIdirectory\fR.   The default
value of \fIdirectory\fR is the directory specified by
the \fB-tmpdir\fR option to [\fBconfigure\fR].
Returns an empty string.  Use this command to delete any directories
created by [\fBmakeDirectory\fR].  
.TP
\fBviewFile\fR \fIfile ?directory?\fR
Returns the contents of \fIfile\fR.  This file name
should be relative to \fIdirectory\fR.   The default value of
\fIdirectory\fR is the directory specified by
the \fB-tmpdir\fR option to [\fBconfigure\fR].  Use this command
as a convenient way to turn the contents of a file generated
by a test into the result of that test for matching against
an expected result.  The contents of the file are read using
the binary encoding, so the exact byte for byte contents are returned.
.TP
\fBrunAllTests\fR
This is a master command meant to run an entire suite of tests,
spanning multiple files and/or directories, as governed by
the configurable options of \fBtcltest\fR.


This command should be used in your 'all.tcl' file.  It is used to
loop over test files and directories, determining which test files to
run and then running them.  Note that this test calls
[\fBcleanupTests\fR]; if using this proc in your 'all.tcl' file, you
should not call [\fBcleanupTests\fR] explicitly in that file. See the
sample 'all.tcl' file in the \fI"Examples"\fR section.


.TP
\fBcleanupTests\fR \fI?multipleFiles?\fR
Intended to clean up and summarize after several tests have been
run.  In a simple test file, [\fBcleanupTests\fR] should be
called wihout arguments at the end of the file after
all [\fBtest\fR]s.  When called without arguments, \fImultipleFiles\fR
has a default value of false.



This command should be called at the end of a test file.  It prints
statistics about the tests run and removes files that were created by
[\fBmakeDirectory\fR] and [\fBmakeFile\fR].  Names
of files and directories created outside of 
[\fBmakeFile\fR] and [\fBmakeDirectory\fR] and
never deleted are printed to [\fBoutputChannel\fR].  This command
also restores the original shell environment, as described by the ::env
array. \fIcalledFromAllFile\fR should be specified as a true value if
[\fBcleanupTests\fR] is called explicitly from an "all.tcl"
file.  Tcl files are generally used to run multiple tests.  The
[\fBcleanupTests\fR] command returns an empty string.  For
more details on how to run multiple tests, please see the section
\fI"Running test files"\fR.  


.SH "CONFIGURATION COMMANDS"
.TP
\fBconfigure\fR
Returns the list of configurable options supported by \fBtcltest\fR.
See \fBCONFIGURABLE OPTIONS\fR below for the full list of options,
their valid values, and their effect on \fBtcltest\fR operations.
.TP
\fBconfigure \fIoption\fR
Returns the current value of the supported configurable option \fIoption\fR.
Raises an error if \fIoption\fR is not a supported configurable option.
.TP
\fBconfigure \fIoption value ?option value ...?\fR
Sets the value of each configurable option \fIoption\fR to the
corresponding value \fIvalue\fR, in order.  Raises an error if
an \fIoption\fR is not a supported configurable option, or if
\fIvalue\fR is not a valid value for the corresponding \fIoption\fR,
or if a \fIvalue\fR is not provided.  When an error is raised, the
operation of [\fBconfigure\fR] is halted, and subsequent \fIoption value\fR
arguments are not processed.
.sp
If the environment variable \fB::env(TCLTEST_OPTIONS)\fR exists when
the \fBtcltest\fR package is loaded (by [\fBpackage require tcltest\fR])
then it value is taken as a list of arguments to pass to [\fBconfigure\fR].
This allows the default values of the configuration options to be
set by the environment.
.TP
\fBcustomMatch \fImode script\fR
Registers \fImode\fR as a new legal value of the \fB-match\fR option
to [\fBtest\fR].  When the \fB-match \fImode\fR option is
passed to [\fBtest\fR], the script \fIscript\fR will be evaluated
to compare the actual result of evaluating the body of the test
to the expected result.
To perform the match, the \fIscript\fR is completed with two additional
words, the expected result, and the actual result, and the completed script
is evaluated in the global namespace.
The completed script is expected to return a boolean value indicating
whether or not the results match.  The built-in matching modes of
[\fBtest\fR] are \fBexact\fR, \fBglob\fR, and \fBregexp\fR.
.TP
\fBtestConstraint \fIconstraint ?boolean?\fR
Sets or returns the boolean value associated with the named \fIconstraint\fR.
See \fBTEST CONSTRAINTS\fR below for more information.
.TP
\fBinterpreter\fR \fI?executableName?\fR
Sets or returns the name of the executable to be [\fBexec\fR]ed by
[\fBrunAllTests\fR] to run each test file when
[\fBconfigure -singleproc\fR] is false.
The default value for [\fBinterpreter\fR] is the name of the
currently running program as returned by [\fBinfo nameofexecutable\fR].
.TP
\fBoutputChannel\fR \fI?channelID?\fR
Sets or returns the output channel ID.  This defaults to stdout.
Any test that prints test related output should send
that output to [\fBoutputChannel\fR] rather than letting
that output default to stdout.
.TP
\fBerrorChannel\fR \fI?channelID?\fR
Sets or returns the error channel ID.  This defaults to stderr.
Any test that prints error messages should send
that output to [\fBerrorChannel\fR] rather than printing
directly to stderr.
.SH "SHORTCUT COMMANDS"
.TP
\fBdebug \fI?level?\fR
Same as [\fBconfigure -debug \fI?level?\fR].

Same as [\fBconfigure -testdir \fI?directory?\fR].
.TP
\fBverbose \fI?level?\fR
Same as [\fBconfigure -verbose \fI?level?\fR].
.SH "OTHER COMMANDS"
.PP
The remaining commands provided by \fBtcltest\fR have better
alternatives provided by Tcl itself.  They are retained to
support existing test suites, but should be avoided in new
code.
.TP
\fBworkingDirectory\fR \fI?directoryName?\fR
Sets or returns the current working directory when the test suite is
running.  The default value for workingDirectory is the directory in
which the test suite was launched.  The Tcl commands [\fBcd\fR] and
[\fBpwd\fR] are sufficient replacements.
.TP
\fBnormalizeMsg\fR \fImsg\fR
Returns the result of removing the ``extra'' newlines from \fImsg\fR,
where ``extra'' is rather imprecise.  Tcl offers plenty of string
processing commands to modify strings as you wish, and
[\fBcustomMatch\fR] allows flexible matching of actual and expected
results.
.TP
\fBnormalizePath\fR \fIpathVar\fR
Resolves symlinks in a path, thus creating a path without internal
redirection.  It is assumed that \fIpathVar\fR is absolute.
\fIpathVar\fR is modified in place.  The Tcl command [\fBfile normalize\fR]
is a sufficient replacement.
.TP
\fBbytestring\fR \fIstring\fR
Construct a string that consists of the requested sequence of bytes,
as opposed to a string of properly formed UTF-8 characters using the
value supplied in \fIstring\fR.  This allows the tester to create
denormalized or improperly formed strings to pass to C procedures that
are supposed to accept strings with embedded NULL types and confirm
that a string result has a certain pattern of bytes.  This is
exactly equivalent to the Tcl command [\fBencoding convertfrom identity\fR].







.SH TESTS
The \fBtest\fR procedure runs a test script and prints an error
message if the script's result does not match the expected result.
Two syntaxes are provided for specifying the attributes of the tests.
The first uses a separate argument for each of the attributes and
values.  The second form places all of the attributes and values
together into a single argument; the argument must have proper list
structure, with the elements of the list being the attributes and
values.  The second form makes it easy to construct multi-line
scripts, since the braces around the whole list make it unnecessary to
include a backslash at the end of each line.  In the second form, no
command or variable substitutions are performed on the attribute
names.  This makes the behavior of the second form different from the
first form in some cases.
.PP
The first form for the \fBtest\fR command:
.CS
test \fIname\fR \fIdescription\fR
    ?-constraints \fIkeywordList|expression\fR
    ?-setup \fIsetupScript\fR?
    ?-body \fItestScript\fR?
    ?-cleanup \fIcleanupScript\fR?
    ?-result \fIexpectedAnswer\fR?
    ?-output \fIexpectedOutput\fR?
    ?-errorOutput \fIexpectedError\fR?
    ?-returnCodes \fIcodeList\fR?
    ?-match \fImode\fR?
.CE
.PP
The second form for the \fBtest\fR command (adds brace grouping):
.CS
test \fIname\fR \fIdescription\fR {
    ?-constraints \fIkeywordList|expression\fR
    ?-setup \fIsetupScript\fR?
    ?-body \fItestScript\fR?
    ?-cleanup \fIcleanupScript\fR?
    ?-result \fIexpectedAnswer\fR?
    ?-output\fIexpectedOutput\fR?
    ?-errorOutput \fIexpectedError\fR?
    ?-returnCodes \fIcodeList\fR?
    ?-match \fImode\fR?
}
.CE
The \fIname\fR argument should follow the pattern:
.CS
<target>-<majorNum>.<minorNum>
.CE
For white-box (regression) tests, the target should be the name of the
C function or Tcl procedure being tested.  For black-box tests, the
target should be the name of the feature being tested.  Related tests
should share a major number.
.PP
The \fIdescription\fR should be a short textual description of the
test.  It is generally used to help humans 
understand the purpose of the test.  The name of a Tcl or C function
being tested should be included in the description for regression
tests.  If the test case exists to reproduce a bug, include the bug ID
in the description. 
.PP
Valid attributes and associated values are:
.TP
\fB-constraints \fIkeywordList|expression\fR
The optional \fIconstraints\fR attribute can be list of one or more
keywords or an expression.  If the \fIconstraints\fR value consists of
keywords, each of these keywords being the name of a constraint
defined by a call to \fItcltest::testConstraint\fR.  If any of these
elements is false or does 
not exist, the test is skipped.  If the \fIconstraints\fR argument
consists of an expression, that expression is evaluated. If the
expression evaluates to true, then the test is run.  Appropriate
constraints should be added to any tests that should
not always be run.  See the "Test Constraints" section for a list of built-in 
constraints and information on how to add your own constraints.
.TP
\fB-setup \fIscript\fR
The optional \fIsetup\fR attribute indicates a script that will be run
before the script indicated by the \fIscript\fR attribute.  If setup
fails, the test will fail.
.TP
\fB-body \fIscript\fR
The \fIbody\fR attribute indicates the script to run to carry out the 
test.  It must return a result that can be checked for correctness.
If left unspecified, the script value will be {}.
.TP
\fB-cleanup \fIscript\fR
The optional \fIcleanup\fR attribute indicates a script that will be
run after the script indicated by the \fIscript\fR attribute.  If
cleanup fails, the test will fail.  
.TP
\fB-match \fImode\fR
The \fImatch\fR attribute determines how expected answers supplied in
\fIresult\fR, \fIoutput\fR, and \fIerrorOutput\fR are compared.  Valid
options for the value supplied are ``regexp'', ``glob'', ``exact'',
and any value registered by a prior call to \fItcltest::customMatch\fR.
If \fImatch\fR is not specified, the comparisons will be
done in ``exact'' mode by default.
.TP
\fB-result \fIexpectedValue\fR
The \fIresult\fR attribute supplies the comparison value with which
the return value from script will be compared. 
If left unspecified, the default
\fIexpectedValue\fR will be the empty list.
.TP
\fB-output \fIexpectedValue\fR
The \fIoutput\fR attribute supplies the comparison value with which
any output sent to stdout or tcltest::outputChannel during the script
run will be compared.  Note that only output printed using
puts is used for comparison.  If \fIoutput\fR is not specified, output
sent to stdout and tcltest::outputChannel is not processed for comparison.
.TP
\fB-errorOutput \fIexpectedValue\fR
The \fIerrorOutput\fR attribute supplies the comparison value with which
any output sent to stderr or tcltest::errorChannel during the script
run will be compared. Note that only output printed using
puts is used for comparison.  If \fIerrorOutput\fR is not specified, output
sent to stderr and tcltest::errorChannel is not processed for comparison.
.TP
\fB-returnCodes \fIexpectedCodeList\fR
The optional \fIreturnCodes\fR attribute indicates which return codes
from the script supplied with the \fIscript\fR attribute are correct.
Default values for \fIexpectedCodeList\fR are 0 (normal return) and 2
(return exception).  Symbolic values \fInormal\fR (0), \fIerror\fR
(1), \fIreturn\fR (2), \fIbreak\fR (3), and \fIcontinue\fR (4) can be
used in the \fIexpectedCodeList\fR list.
.PP
To pass, a test must successfully execute its setup, script, and
cleanup code.  The return code of the test and its return values must
match expected values, and if specified, output and error data from
the test must match expected output and error values. If all of these
conditions are not met, then the test fails.
.SH "TEST CONSTRAINTS"
Constraints are used to determine whether or not a test should be skipped.
If a test is constrained by ``unixOnly'', then it will only be run if
the value of the constraint is true.  Several
constraints are defined in the \fBtcltest\fR package.  To add 
constraints, you can call \fBtcltest::testConstraint\fR
with the appropriate arguments in your own test file.
.PP
The following is a list of constraints defined in the \fBtcltest\fR package:
.TP
\fIsingleTestInterp\fR
test can only be run if all test files are sourced into a single interpreter

.TP
\fItempNotWin\fR
test can not be run on Windows.  This flag is used to temporarily
disable a test. 
.TP
\fItempNotMac\fR
test can not be run on a Mac.  This flag is used
to temporarily disable a test.
.TP
\fIunixCrash\fR
test crashes if it's run on UNIX.  This flag is used to temporarily
disable a test. 
.TP
\fIwinCrash\fR
test crashes if it's run on Windows.  This flag is used to temporarily
disable a test. 
.TP
\fImacCrash\fR
test crashes if it's run on a Mac.  This flag is used to temporarily
disable a test. 
.TP
\fIemptyTest\fR
test is empty, and so not worth running, but it remains as a
place-holder for a test to be written in the future.  This constraint
always causes tests to be skipped.
.TP
\fIknownBug\fR
test is known to fail and the bug is not yet fixed.  This constraint
always causes tests to be skipped unless the user specifies otherwise.
See the "Introduction" section for more details.
.TP
\fInonPortable\fR

Some tests are inherently non-portable because they depend on things
like word length, file system configuration, window manager, etc.
These tests are only run in the main Tcl development directory where
the configuration is well known.  This constraint always causes tests
to be skipped unless the user specifies otherwise.  
.TP
\fIuserInteraction\fR
test requires interaction from the user.  This constraint always
causes tests to be skipped unless the user specifies otherwise.  
.TP
\fIinteractive\fR
test can only be run in if the interpreter is in interactive mode 
(when the global tcl_interactive variable is set to 1).
.TP
\fInonBlockFiles\fR
test can only be run if platform supports setting files into
nonblocking mode 
.TP
\fIasyncPipeClose\fR
test can only be run if platform supports async flush and async close
on a pipe 
.TP

\fB-constraints <list>\fR
tests with any constraints in <list> will not be skipped.  Note that

.TP
\fB-limitconstraints <bool>\fR
If the argument to this flag is 1, the test harness limits test runs
to those tests that match the constraints listed by the -constraints
flag. Use of this flag requires use of the -constraints flag.  The
default value for this flag is 0 (false).  This is useful if you want
to run \fBonly\fR those tests that match the constraints listed using
the -constraints option.  A tester might want to do this if (for
example) he were
interested in running only those tests that are constrained to be
unixOnly and no other tests.

.RE
.PP
You can specify any of the above options on the command line or by
defining an environment variable named TCLTEST_OPTIONS containing a
list of options (e.g. "-debug 3 -verbose 'pass skip'").  This 
environment variable is evaluated before the command line arguments.
Options specified on the command line override those specified in 
TCLTEST_OPTIONS. 
.PP
A second way to run tests is to start up a shell, load the
\fBtcltest\fR package, and then source an appropriate test file or use
the test command.  To use the options in interactive mode, set
their corresponding tcltest namespace variables after loading the
package.
.PP
See \fI"Test Constraints"\fR for a list of all built-in constraint names.
.PP
A final way to run tests would be to specify which test files to run
within an \fIall.tcl\fR (or otherwise named) file.  This is the
approach used by the Tcl test suite.  This file loads the tcltest
package, sets the location of
the test directory (tcltest::testsDirectory), and then calls the
\fItcltest::runAllTests\fR proc, which determines which test
files to run, how to run them, and calls tcltest::cleanupTests to
determine the summary status of the test suite.  
.PP
A more elaborate \fIall.tcl\fR file might do some pre- and
post-processing before sourcing 
each .test file, use separate interpreters for each file, or handle
complex directory structures.  
For an example of an all.tcl file,
please see the "Examples" section of this document.
.SH "TEST OUTPUT"
After all specified test files are run, the number of tests
passed, skipped, and failed is printed to
\fBtcltest::outputChannel\fR.  Aside from this 
statistical information, output can be controlled on a per-test basis
by the \fBtcltest::verbose\fR variable.
.PP
\fBtcltest::verbose\fR can be set to any combination of "body", 
"skip", "pass", "start", or "error".  The default value of
\fBtcltest::verbose\fR is "body".  If "body"  is present, then the
entire body of the test is printed for each failed test, otherwise
only the test's name, desired output, and 
actual output, are printed for each failed test.  If "pass" is present,
then a line is printed for each passed test, otherwise no line is
printed for passed tests.  If "skip" is present, then a line (containing
the constraints that cause the test to be skipped) is printed for each
skipped test, otherwise no line is printed for skipped tests.  If "start"
is present, then a line is printed each time a new test starts.
If "error" is present, then the content of errorInfo and errorCode (if
they are defined) is printed for each test whose return code doesn't
match its expected return code.
.PP
You can set \fBtcltest::verbose\fR either interactively (after the
\fBtcltest\fR package has been loaded) or by using the command line
argument \fB-verbose\fR, for example:
.CS
tclsh socket.test -verbose 'body pass skip'
.CE
.SH "CONTENTS OF A TEST FILE"
Test files should begin by loading the \fBtcltest\fR package:
.CS
package require tcltest
namespace import -force tcltest::*
.CE
Test files should end by cleaning up after themselves and calling
\fBtcltest::cleanupTests\fR.  The \fBtcltest::cleanupTests\fR
procedure prints statistics about the number of tests that passed,
skipped, and failed, and removes all files that were created using the
\fBtcltest::makeFile\fR and \fBtcltest::makeDirectory\fR procedures.
.CS
# Remove files created by these tests
# Change to original working directory
# Unset global arrays
tcltest::cleanupTests
return
.CE
When naming test files, file names should end with a .test extension.
The names of test files that contain regression (or glass-box) tests
should correspond to the Tcl or C code file that they are testing.
For example, the test file for the C file "tclCmdAH.c" is "cmdAH.test".  
.SH "SELECTING TESTS FOR EXECUTION"
.PP
Normally, all the tests in a file are run whenever the file is
sourced.  An individual test will be skipped if one of the following
conditions is met:
.IP [1]
the \fIname\fR of the tests does not match (using glob style matching)
one or more elements in the \fBtcltest::match\fR variable
.IP [2]
the \fIname\fR of the tests matches (using glob style matching) one or
more elements in the \fBtcltest::skip\fR variable 
.IP [3]
the \fIconstraints\fR argument to the \fBtcltest::test\fR call, if
given, contains one or more false elements. 
.PP
You can set \fBtcltest::match\fR and/or \fBtcltest::skip\fR
either interactively (after the \fBtcltest\fR package has been
sourced), or by using the command line arguments \fB-match\fR and
\fB-skip\fR, for example: 
.PP
.CS
tclsh info.test -match '*-5.* *-7.*' -skip '*-7.1*'
.CE
.PP
Be sure to use the proper quoting convention so that your shell does
not perform the glob substitution on the match or skip patterns you
specify.
.PP
Predefined constraints (e.g. \fIknownBug\fR and \fInonPortable\fR) can be
overridden either interactively (after the \fBtcltest\fR package has been
sourced) by setting the proper constraint
or by using the \fB-constraints\fR command line option with the name of the
constraint in the argument.  The following example shows how to run
tests that are constrained by the \fIknownBug\fR and \fInonPortable\fR
restrictions:
.PP
.CS
tclsh all.tcl -constraints "knownBug nonPortable"
.CE
.PP
See the \fI"Constraints"\fR section for information about using
built-in constraints and adding new ones.
.PP
When tests are run from within an \fBall.tcl\fR file, all files with a
``\fI.test\fR'' extension are normally run.  An individual test file will
be skipped if one of the following conditions is met:
.IP [1]
the \fIname\fR of the test files does not match (using glob style matching)
one or more elements in the \fBtcltest::matchFiles\fR variable
.IP [2]
the \fIname\fR of the test file matches (using glob style matching) one or
more elements in the \fBtcltest::skipFiles\fR variable 
.PP
You can set \fBtcltest::matchFiles\fR and/or \fBtcltest::skipFiles\fR
either interactively (after the \fBtcltest\fR package has been
sourced), or by using the command line arguments \fB-file\fR and
\fB-notfile\fR, for example: 
.PP
.CS
tclsh info.test -file 'unix*.test' -notfile 'unixNotfy.test'
.CE
.PP
Additionally, if tests are run from within an 'all.tcl' containing a
call to \fBtcltest::runAllTests\fR, any subdirectory of
\fItcltest::testsDirectory\fR containing an 'all.tcl' file will also
be run.  Individual test subdirectories will be skipped if one of the
following conditions is met:
.IP [1]
the \fIname\fR of the directory does not match (using glob style matching)
one or more elements in the \fBtcltest::matchDirectories\fR variable
.IP [2]
the \fIname\fR of the directory matches (using glob style matching) one or
more elements in the \fBtcltest::skipDirectories\fR variable 
.PP
You can set \fBtcltest::matchDirectories\fR and/or \fBtcltest::skipDirectories\fR
either interactively (after the \fBtcltest\fR package has been
sourced), or by using the command line arguments \fB-relateddir\fR and
\fB-asidefromdir\fR, for example: 
.PP
.CS
tclsh info.test -relateddir 'subdir*' -asidefromdir 'subdir2'

.SH "HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THE TEST HARNESS"

.TP
\fBtcltest::cleanupTestsHook\fR
do additional cleanup

.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
There are two known issues related to nested evaluations of [\fBtest\fR].  
The first issue relates to the stack level in which test scripts are
executed.  Tests nested within other tests may be executed at the same
stack level as the outermost test.  For example, in the following code: 
.CS
test level-1.1 {level 1} {
    -body {
        test level-2.1 {level 2} {
        }
    }
}
.CE
any script executed in level-2.1 may be executed at the same stack
level as the script defined for level-1.1.  
.PP
In addition, while two [\fBtestfR]s have been run, results will only
be reported by [\fRcleanupTests\fB] for tests at the same level as
test level-1.1.  However, test results for all tests run prior to
level-1.1 will be available when test level-2.1 runs.  What this
means is that if you try to access the test results for test level-2.1,
it will may say that 'm' tests have run, 'n' tests have been skipped,
'o' tests have passed and 'p' tests have failed, where 'm', 'n', 'o',
and 'p' refer to tests that were run at the same test level as
test level-1.1. 
.PP
Implementation of output and error comparison in the test command
depends on usage of puts in your application code.  Output is
intercepted by redefining the puts command while the defined test
script is being run.  Errors thrown by C procedures or printed
directly from C applications will not be caught by the test command.
Therefore, usage of the \fB-output\fR and \fB-errorOuput\fR
options to [\fBtest\fR] is useful only for pure Tcl applications
that use [\fBputs\fR] to produce output.
