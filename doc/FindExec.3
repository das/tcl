.SH NAME
Tcl_FindExecutable \- identify the binary file containing the application
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
char *
\fBTcl_FindExecutable\fR(\fIargv0\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS char *argv0 in
.AP char *argv0 in
The first command-line argument to the program, which gives the
application's name.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure computes the full path name of the executable file
from which the application was invoked and saves it for Tcl's
internal use.
The executable's path name is needed for several purposes in
Tcl.  For example, it is needed on some platforms in the
implementation of the \fBload\fR command.
It is also returned by the \fBinfo nameofexecutable\fR command.
.PP
On UNIX platforms this procedure is typically invoked as the very
first thing in the application's main program;  it must be passed
\fIargv[0]\fR as its argument.  \fBTcl_FindExecutable\fR uses \fIargv0\fR
along with the \fBPATH\fR environment variable to find the
application's executable, if possible.  If it fails to find
the binary, then future calls to \fBinfo nameofexecutable\fR
will return an empty string.

.SH KEYWORDS
binary, executable file
