.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Interp **termPtr;
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter in which to execute the script.  The interpreter's result is
modified to hold the result or error message from the script.
.AP Tcl_Obj *objPtr in
A Tcl object containing the script to execute.
.AP int flags in
ORed combination of flag bits that specify additional options.
\fBTCL_EVAL_GLOBAL\fR and \fBTCL_EVAL_DIRECT\fR are currently supported.
.AP char *fileName in
Name of a file containing a Tcl script.
.AP int *objc in
The number of objects in the array pointed to by \fIobjPtr\fR;
this is also the number of words in the command.
.AP Tcl_Obj **objv in
Points to an array of pointers to objects; each object holds the
value of a single word in the command to execute.
.AP char *command in
Points to the beginning of the string representation of the
command, if there is one.  If the string representation of the
command is unknown then an empty string should be supplied.
This information is used for command tracing.
.AP int numBytes in
The number of bytes in \fIcommand\fR or \fIscript\fR, not including any
null terminating character.  If \-1, then all characters up to the
first null byte are used.
.AP char *script in
Points to first byte of script to execute.  This script must be in
writable memory: temporary modifications are made to it during
parsing.
.AP char *string in
String forming part of a Tcl script.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The procedures described here are invoked to execute Tcl scripts in
various forms.
\fBTcl_EvalObj\fR is the core procedure and is used by many of the others.
It executes the commands in the script stored in \fIobjPtr\fR
until either an error occurs or the end of the script is reached.
If this is the first time \fIobjPtr\fR has been executed,
its commands are compiled into bytecode instructions
which are then executed.  The
bytecodes are saved in \fIobjPtr\fR so that the compilation step
can be skipped if the object is evaluated again in the future.
.PP
The return value from \fBTcl_EvalObj\fR (and all the other procedures
described here) is a Tcl completion code with
one of the values \fBTCL_OK\fR, \fBTCL_ERROR\fR, \fBTCL_RETURN\fR,
\fBTCL_BREAK\fR, or \fBTCL_CONTINUE\fR.
In addition, a result value or error message is left in \fIinterp\fR's
result; it can be retrieved using \fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_EvalFile\fR reads the file given by \fIfileName\fR and evaluates
its contents as a Tcl script.  It returns the same information as
\fBTcl_EvalObj\fR.
If the file couldn't be read then a Tcl error is returned to describe
why the file couldn't be read.
.PP
\fBTcl_EvalObjv\fR executes a single pre-parsed command instead of a
script.  The \fIobjc\fR and \fIobjv\fR arguments contain the values
of the words for the Tcl command, one word in each object in
\fIobjv\fR.  \fBTcl_EvalObjv\fR evaluates the command and returns
a completion code and result just like \fBTcl_EvalObj\fR.
The \fIcommand\fR argument is used only to provide contextual information
to command traces.  Note: unlike the other procedures described here,
\fBTcl_EvalObjv\fR does not add any information to the \fBerrorInfo\fR
variable after an error.  It is up to the caller to do this, if it
wishes.
.PP
\fBTcl_Eval\fR is similar to \fBTcl_EvalObj\fR except that
the script to be executed is supplied as a string instead of an
object and no compilation occurs.  The string is parsed and executed
directly (using \fBTcl_EvalObjv\fR) instead of compiling it and
executing the bytecodes.  In situations where it is known that the
script will never be executed again, \fBTcl_Eval\fR may be
faster than \fBTcl_EvalObj\fR.  \fBTcl_Eval\fR returns a completion
code and result just like \fBTcl_EvalObj\fR.  Note: for backward
compatibility with versions before Tcl 8.0, \fBTcl_Eval\fR
copies the object result in \fIinterp\fR to \fIinterp->result\fR
where it can be accessed directly.  This makes \fBTcl_Eval\fR somewhat
slower than \fBTcl_Eval2\fR, which doesn't do the copy.
.PP
\fBTcl_Eval2\fR is an extended version of \fBTcl_Eval\fR that takes
additional arguments \fInumBytes\fR and \fIflags\fR.  For the
efficiency reason given above, \fBTcl_Eval2\fR is generally preferred
over \fBTcl_Eval\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_GlobalEval\fR is an older procedure that is now deprecated.
It is similar to \fBTcl_Eval\fR except that the script is evaluated in
the global namespace and its variable context consists of global
variables only (it ignores any Tcl procedures that are active).
Like \fBTcl_Eval\fR, it leaves a null-terminated
string version of the result in \fIinterp->result\fR where it can
be accessed directly.
.PP
\fBTcl_VarEval\fR takes any number of string arguments
of any length, concatenates them into a single string,
then calls \fBTcl_Eval\fR to execute that string as a Tcl command.
It returns the result of the command and also modifies
\fIinterp->result\fR in the same way as \fBTcl_Eval\fR.
The last argument to \fBTcl_VarEval\fR must be NULL to indicate the end
of arguments.  \fBTcl_VarEval\fR is now deprecated.

.SH "FLAG BITS"
Any ORed combination of the following values may be used for the
\fIflags\fR argument to procedures such as \fBTcl_EvalObj\fR:
.TP 23
\fBTCL_EVAL_DIRECT\fR
This flag is only used by \fBTcl_EvalObj\fR; it is ignored by
other procedures.  If this flag bit is set, the script is not
compiled to bytecodes; instead it is executed directly
as is done by \fBTcl_Eval2\fR.  The
\fBTCL_EVAL_DIRECT\fR flag is useful in situations where the
contents of an object are going to change immediately, so the
bytecodes won't be reused in a future execution.  In this case,
it's faster to execute the script directly.
.TP 23
\fBTCL_EVAL_GLOBAL\fR
If this flag is set, the script is processed at global level.  This
means that it is evaluated in the global namespace and its variable
context consists of global variables only (it ignores any Tcl
procedures at are active).

.SH "MISCELLANEOUS DETAILS"
.PP
During the processing of a Tcl command it is legal to make nested
calls to evaluate other commands (this is how procedures and
some control structures are implemented).
If a code other than \fBTCL_OK\fR is returned
from a nested \fBTcl_EvalObj\fR invocation,
then the caller should normally return immediately,
passing that same return code back to its caller,
and so on until the top-level application is reached.
A few commands, like \fBfor\fR, will check for certain
return codes, like \fBTCL_BREAK\fR and \fBTCL_CONTINUE\fR, and process them
specially without returning.
.PP
\fBTcl_EvalObj\fR keeps track of how many nested \fBTcl_EvalObj\fR
invocations are in progress for \fIinterp\fR.
If a code of \fBTCL_RETURN\fR, \fBTCL_BREAK\fR, or \fBTCL_CONTINUE\fR is
about to be returned from the topmost \fBTcl_EvalObj\fR
invocation for \fIinterp\fR,
it converts the return code to \fBTCL_ERROR\fR
and sets \fIinterp\fR's result to an error message indicating that
the \fBreturn\fR, \fBbreak\fR, or \fBcontinue\fR command was
invoked in an inappropriate place.
This means that top-level applications should never see a return code
from \fBTcl_EvalObj\fR other then \fBTCL_OK\fR or \fBTCL_ERROR\fR.
