.SH NAME
lsearch \- See if a list contains a particular element
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlsearch \fR?\fIoptions\fR? \fIlist pattern\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command searches the elements of \fIlist\fR to see if one
of them matches \fIpattern\fR.  If so, the command returns the index
of the first matching element.  If not, the command returns \fB\-1\fR.
The \fIoption\fR arguments indicates how the elements of the list are to
be matched against \fIpattern\fR and it must have one of the following
values:
.TP
\fB\-ascii\fR
The list elements are to be examined as ASCII strings.  This option is only
meaningful when used with \fB\-exact\fR or \fB\-sorted\fR.
.TP
\fB\-decreasing\fR
The list elements are sorted in decreasing order.  This option is only
meaningful when used with \fB\-sorted\fR.
.TP
\fB\-dictionary\fR
The list elements are to be compared using dictionary-style
comparisons.  This option is only meaningful when used with
\fB\-exact\fR or \fB\-sorted\fR.
.TP
\fB\-exact\fR
The list element must contain exactly the same string as \fIpattern\fR.
.TP
\fB\-increasing\fR
The list elements are sorted in increasing order.  This option is only
meaningful when used with \fB\-sorted\fR.
.TP
\fB\-integer\fR
The list elements are to be compared as integers.  This option is only
meaningful when used with \fB\-exact\fR or \fB\-sorted\fR.
.TP
\fB\-glob\fR
\fIPattern\fR is a glob-style pattern which is matched against each list
element using the same rules as the \fBstring match\fR command.
.TP
\fB\-real\fR
The list elements are to be compared as floating-point values.  This
option is only meaningful when used with \fB\-exact\fR or \fB\-sorted\fR.
.TP
\fB\-regexp\fR
\fIPattern\fR is treated as a regular expression and matched against
each list element using the rules described in the \fBre_syntax\fR
reference page.
.TP
\fB\-sorted\fR
The list elements are in sorted order.  If this option is specified,
\fBlsearch\fR will use a more efficient searching algorithm to search
\fIlist\fR.  If no other options are specified, \fIlist\fR is assumed
to be sorted in increasing order, and to contain ASCII strings.  This
option cannot be used with \fB\-glob\fR or \fB\-regexp\fR.
.PP
If \fIoption\fR is omitted then it defaults to \fB\-glob\fR.  If more
than one of \fB\-exact\fR, \fB\-glob\fR, \fB\-regexp\fR, and
\fB\-sorted\fR is specified, whichever option is specified last takes
precendence.  If more than one of \fB\-ascii\fR, \fB\-dictionary\fR,
\fB\-integer\fR and \fB\-real\fR is specified, the option specified
last takes precendence.  If more than one of \fB\-increasing\fR and
\fB\-decreasing\fR is specified, the option specified last takes precedence.
