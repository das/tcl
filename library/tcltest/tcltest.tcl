# tcltest.tcl --
#
#	This file contains support code for the Tcl test suite.  It 
#       defines the tcltest namespace and finds and defines the output
#       directory, constraints available, output and error channels, etc. used
#       by Tcl tests.  See the tcltest man page for more details.
#       
#       This design was based on the Tcl testing approach designed and
#       initially implemented by Mary Ann May-Pumphrey of Sun Microsystems.

# runTest --
#
# This is the defnition of the version 1.0 test routine for tcltest.  It is
# provided here for backward compatibility.  It is also used as the 'backbone'
# of the test procedure, as in, this is where all the work really gets done.
# 
# This procedure runs a test and prints an error message if the test fails.
# If tcltest::verbose has been set, it also prints a message even if the
# test succeeds.  The test will be skipped if it doesn't match the
# tcltest::match variable, if it matches an element in
# tcltest::skip, or if one of the elements of "constraints" turns
# out not to be true.
#
# Arguments:
# name -		Name of test, in the form foo-1.2.
# description -		Short textual description of the test, to
#			help humans understand what it does.
# constraints -		A list of one or more keywords, each of
#			which must be the name of an element in
#			the array "tcltest::testConstraints".  If any of these
#			elements is zero, the test is skipped.
#			This argument may be omitted.
# script -		Script to run to carry out the test.  It must
#			return a result that can be checked for
#			correctness.
# expectedAnswer -	Expected result from script.
# 
# Behavior depends on the value of testLevel; if testLevel is 1 (top level),
# then events are logged and we track the number of tests run/skipped and why.
# Otherwise, we don't track this information.
# 
# Results:
#    empty list if test is skipped; otherwise returns list containing
#    actual returned value from the test and the return code.
# 
# Side Effects:
#    none.
