.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Every database driver for TDBC (Tcl DataBase Connectivity) implements
a \fIconnection\fR object that represents a connection to a database.
By convention, this object is created by the command,
\fBtdbc::\fR\fIdriver\fR\fB::connection\fR \fBcreate\fR.
This command accepts the name of a Tcl command that will represent the
connection and a possible set of options (see \fBCONFIGURATION
OPTIONS\fR). It establishes a connection to the database and returns
the name of the newly-created Tcl command.
.PP
The \fBconfigure\fR object command on a database connection, if
presented with no arguments, returns a list of alternating keywords
and values representing the connection's current configuration. If
presented with a single argument \fI-option\fR, it returns the
configured value of the given option. Otherwise, it must be given an
even number of arguments which are alternating options and values. The
specified options receive the specified values, and nothing is
returned.
.PP
The \fBclose\fR object command on a database connection closes the
connection. All active statements and result sets on the connection
are closed. Any uncommitted transaction is rolled back. The object
command is deleted.
.PP
The \fBprepare\fR object command on a database connection prepares a SQL
statement for execution. The \fIsql-code\fR argument must contain a
single SQL statement to be executed. Bound variables may be
included. See \fBSQL STATEMENTS\fR for a further description of the
SQL that is accepted by this command. The return value is a
newly-created Tcl command that represents the statement. See
tdbc_statement(n) for the interface accepted by a statement.
.PP
On a database connection where the underlying database and driver
support stored procedures, the \fBpreparecall\fR
object command prepares a call to a stored procedure for execution.
The syntax of the stored procedure call is:
.sp
?\fIresultvar\fR =? \fIprocname\fR(?\fIarg\fR ?, \fIarg\fR...?)
.sp
The return value is a
newly-created Tcl command that represents the statement. See
tdbc_statement(n) for the interface accepted by a statement.
.PP
The \fBstatements\fR object command returns a list of statements 
that have been created by \fBprepare\fR and \fBpreparecall\fR
statements against the given connection and have not yet been closed.
.PP
The \fBresultsets\fR object command returns a list of result sets
that have been obtained by executing statements prepared using the
given connection and not yet closed.
.PP
The \fBtables\fR object command allows the program to query the
connection for the names of tables that exist in the database.
The optional \fBpattern\fR parameter is a pattern to match the name of
a table. It may contain the SQL wild-card characters '\fB%\fR' and
'\fB_\fR'. The return value is a dictionary whose keys are table names
and whose values are subdictionaries. See the documentation for the
individual database driver for the interpretation of the values.
.PP
The \fBcolumns\fR object command allows the program to query the
connection for the names of columns that exist in a given table.
The optional \fBpattern\fR parameter is a pattern to match the name of
a column. It may contain the SQL wild-card characters '\fB%\fR' and
'\fB_\fR'. The return value is a dictionary whose keys are column names
and whose values are dictionaries. Each of the subdictionaries will
contain at least the following keys and values (and may contain others
whose usage is determined by a specific database driver).
.IP \fBtype\fR
Contains the data type of the column, and will generally be chosen
from the set, 
\fBbigint\fR, \fBbinary\fR, \fBbit\fR, \fBchar\fR, \fBdate\fR,
\fBdecimal\fR, \fBdouble\fR, \fBfloat\fR, \fBinteger\fR,
\fBlongvarbinary\fR, \fBlongvarchar\fR, \fBnumeric\fR, \fBreal\fR,
\fBtime\fR, \fBtimestamp\fR, \fBsmallint\fR, \fBtinyint\fR,
\fBvarbinary\fR, and \fBvarchar\fR. (If the column has a type that
cannot be represented as one of the above, \fBtype\fR will contain
a driver-dependent description of the type.)
.IP \fBprecision\fR
Contains the precision of the column in bits, decimal digits, or the
width in characters, according to the type.
.IP \fBscale\fR
Contains the scale of the column (the number of digits after the radix
point), for types that support the concept.
.IP \fBnullable\fR
Contains 1 if the column can contain NULL values, and 0 otherwise.
.PP
The \fBstarttransaction\fR object command on a database connection
begins a transaction on the database. If the underlying database does
not support atomic, consistent, isolated, durable transactions, the
\fBstarttransaction\fR object command returns an error reporting the
fact. Similarly, if multiple \fBstarttransaction\fR commands are executed
withough an intervening \fBcommit\fR or \fBrollback\fR command, an
error is returned unless the underlying database supports nested
transactions.
.PP
The \fBcommit\fR object command on a database connection ends the most
recent transaction started by \fBstarttransaction\fR and commits
changes to the database.
.PP
The \fBrollback\fR object command on a database connection rolls back
the most recent transaction started by \fBstarttransaction\fR. The
state of the database is as if nothing happened during the
transaction.
.PP
The \fBtransaction\fR object command on a database connection
presents a simple way of bundling a database transaction. It begins a
transaction, and evaluates the supplied \fIscript\fR argument as a Tcl
script in the caller's scope. If \fIscript\fR terminates normally, or
by \fBbreak\fR, \fBcontinue\fR, or \fBreturn\fR, the transaction is
committed (and any action requested by \fBbreak\fR, \fBcontinue\fR, or
\fBreturn\fR takes place). If the evaluation of \fIscript\fR ends
with an error, the transaction is rolled back and the error is
rethrown. Any other return code is treated similarly to \fBbreak\fR,
\fBcontinue\fR, or \fBreturn\fR.
.PP
The \fBallrows\fR object command prepares a SQL statement (given by
the \fIsql-code\fR parameter) to execute against the database.
It then executes it (see \fBtdbc_statement(n)\fR for details) with the
optional \fIdictionary\fR parameter giving bind variables. Finally,
it uses the \fIallrows\fR object command on the result set (see
\fBtdbc_resultset(n)\fR) to construct a list of the results. Finally, both
result set and statement are closed. The return value is the list of
results. 
.PP
The \fBforeach\fR object command prepares a SQL statement (given by
the \fIsql-code\fR parameter) to execute against the database.
It then executes it (see \fBtdbc_statement(n)\fR for details) with the
optional \fIdictionary\fR parameter giving bind variables. Finally,
it uses the \fIforeach\fR object command on the result set (see
\fBtdbc_resultset(n)\fR) to evaluate the given \fIscript\fR for each row of
the results. Finally, both result set and statement are closed, even
if the given \fIscript\fR results in a \fBreturn\fR, an error, or
an unusual return code. 
.SH "CONFIGURATION OPTIONS"
The configuration options accepted when the connection is created and
on the connection's \fBconfigure\fR object command include the
following, and may include others specific to a database driver.
.IP "\fB-encoding\fR \fIname\fR"
Specifies the encoding to be used in connecting to the database.
The \fIname\fR should be one of the names accepted by the
\fBencoding(n)\fR command. This option is usually unnecessary; most
database drivers can figure out the encoding in use by themselves.
.IP "\fB-isolation\fR \fIlevel\fR"
Specifies the transaction isolation level needed for transactions on
the database. The acceptable values for \fIlevel\fR are shown under
\fBTRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVELS\fR.
.IP "\fB-timeout\fR \fIms\fR"
Specifies the maximum time to wait for a an operation database engine before
reporting an error to the caller. The \fIms\fR argument gives the
maximum time in milliseconds. A value of zero (the default) specifies
that the calling process is to wait indefinitely for database
operations.
.IP "\fB-readonly\fR \fIflag\fR"
Specifies that the connection will not modify the database (if the
Boolean parameter \fIflag\fR is true), or that it may modify the
database (if \fIflag\fR is false). If \fIflag\fR is true, this option
may have the effect of raising the transaction isolation level to
\fIreadonly\fR.
.SH "TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVELS"
The acceptable values for the \fB-isolation\fR configuration option
are as follows:
.IP \fBreaduncommitted\fR
Allows the transaction to read "dirty", that is, uncommitted
data. This isolation level may compromise data integrity, does not
guarantee that foreign keys or uniqueness constraints are satisfied,
and in general does not guarantee data consistency.
.IP \fBreadcommitted\fR
Forbids the transaction from reading "dirty" data, but does not
guarantee repeatable reads; if a transaction reads a row of a database
at a given time, there is no guarantee that the same row will be
available at a later time in the same transaction.
.IP \fBrepeatableread\fR
Guarantees that any row of the database, once read, will have the same
values for the life of a transaction. Still permits "phantom reads"
(that is, newly-added rows appearing if a table is queried a second
time).
.IP \fBserializable\fR
The most restrictive (and most expensive) level of transaction isolation. Any query to the database, if repeated, will return precisely the same results for the life of the transaction, exactly as if the transaction is the only user of the database.
.IP \fBreadonly\fR
Behaves like \fBserializable\fR in that the only results visible to
the transaction are those that were committed prior to the start of
the transaction, but forbids the transaction from modifying the
database.
.PP
A database that does not implement one of these isolation levels
will instead use the next more restrictive isolation level. If the
given level of isolation cannot be obtained, the database interface
throws an error reporting the fact. The default isolation level
is \fBreadcommitted\fR.
.PP
A script should not the isolation level when a transaction is in
progress.
